        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: 01/01/2025</p>
        <p>
            Thank you for choosing to use the RatanKhichi ("the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use the App.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>
            The RatanKhichi is a simple, open-source application that does not collect, store, or process any personal information. We do not ask for access to your contacts, location, or any other personal data. The app operates entirely locally on your device.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Since the RatanKhichi is an offline game, no third-party services (such as analytics, advertising, or data collection platforms) are used. Your data remains entirely on your device.
        </p>

        <h2>Open Source and Transparency</h2>
        <p>
            The RatanKhichi is an open-source project, meaning that the source code is publicly available and can be reviewed by anyone. This ensures transparency in how the app functions and provides confidence that no hidden data collection is occurring. 
             
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            Although the RatanKhichi currently does not collect any data, we may update this Privacy Policy if future versions of the app introduce new features. In such cases, any changes will be clearly communicated via an update to this policy.
        </p>
