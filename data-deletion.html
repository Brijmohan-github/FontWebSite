        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: 01/01/2025</p>
       

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            Although the RatanKhichi currently does not collect any data, we may update this Privacy Policy if future versions of the app introduce new features. In such cases, any changes will be clearly communicated via an update to this policy.
     
<br/>

<h2>Data safety section</h2>
        
        All developers must complete a clear and accurate Data safety section for every app detailing collection, use, and sharing of user data. The developer is responsible for the accuracy of the label and keeping this information up-to-date. Where relevant, the section must be consistent with the disclosures made in the app’s privacy policy. 
        <br/>   
        Please refer to this article for additional information on completing the Data safety section.
        <br/>
        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        All apps must post a privacy policy link in the designated field within Play Console, and a privacy policy link or text within the app itself. The privacy policy must, together with any in-app disclosures, comprehensively disclose how your app accesses, collects, uses, and shares user data, not limited by the data disclosed in the Data safety section. This must include: 
        <br/>
        Developer information and a privacy point of contact or a mechanism to submit inquiries.
        Disclosing the types of personal and sensitive user data your app accesses, collects, uses, and shares; and any parties with which any personal or sensitive user data is shared.
        Secure data handling procedures for personal and sensitive user data.
        The developer’s data retention and deletion policy.
        Clear labeling as a privacy policy (for example, listed as “privacy policy” in title).
        The entity (for example, developer, company) named in the app’s Google Play store listing must appear in the privacy policy or the app must be named in the privacy policy. Apps that do not access any personal and sensitive user data must still submit a privacy policy. 
        <br/>
        Please make sure your privacy policy is available on an active, publicly accessible and non-geofenced URL (no PDFs) and is non-editable.
        <br/>
        <h2>Account Deletion Requirement</h2>  
        If your app allows users to create an account from within your app, then it must also allow users to request for their account to be deleted. Users must have a readily discoverable option to initiate app account deletion from within your app and outside of your app (for example, by visiting your website). A link to this web resource must be entered in the designated URL form field within Play Console.
        <br/>
        When you delete an app account based on a user’s request, you must also delete the user data associated with that app account. Temporary account deactivation, disabling, or “freezing” the app account does not qualify as account deletion. If you need to retain certain data for legitimate reasons such as security, fraud prevention, or regulatory compliance, you must clearly inform users about your data retention practices (for example, within your privacy policy).
        <br/>
